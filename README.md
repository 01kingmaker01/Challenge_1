## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [Twin.Macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) -
  Twin blends the magic of Tailwind with the flexibility of css-in-js
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Through these challenges, I have learned how to use TwinMacro more effectively.
I have used useState hook, and useEffect hook in the react functional component.
My CSS Flexbox and Grid knowledge has been brushed up.


```js
const Container = tw.div`mt-10 mb-6 text-secondary text-xs font-medium md:(mt-12 font-size[.85rem])`;
```

```html
<Container>....</Container>
```

### Continued development

I plan to refine and perfect Twin.Macro components and make code DRY in the future

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - I was able to see documentation for TailwindCSS and write classes for twin macro components through this resource
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Simple guide for CSS Grid
